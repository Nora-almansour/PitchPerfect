# PitchPerfect App Project 

Pitch Perfect is the first project for Udacity ios nanodegree.

This is an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.
